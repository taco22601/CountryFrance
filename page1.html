   </p>

   <p class="center2">
    The Ratatouille and Piperade, is a very overated and hyped. <br>
    But it's named after the funny rat chef, so it goes in top 3

        THE OMELETTE, did you even know the omelette was french? Do you even know what an omelette is? <br>
        It's a delicous anytime of the day (specifically breakfast while camping) food item. <br>
        Wrapped in egg and literally anything you find enjoyable can go inside

    <p class="center2">
        Croque-Monsieur, besides it extremley cool name, it's a delicous french breakfast sandwhich. <br>
        It composes of two peices of bread, a slim slice of ham and melted Gruy√®re (How do you say this) cheese <br>
        tucked in-between the bread. And the more "fancy/elaborate" version, consists of more of that weird cheese.
