       THE DUEL IN THE BACK OF A CAB
   </p>
   
   <p class="center">
       I don't know what crazier; how this duel was fought, or the fact that it's actually true. <br>
       Colonel Barbier-Dufai insulted another officers Cockade (the feather thing on a hat). The other office, Raoul <br>
       was very offended. The situation escalated, into a duel with swords. The colonel was however way more experience. <br>
       Barbier disarmed Raoul 4 times, but Raoul was determined. To make the duel "fair" they came up with a bright idea. <br>
       Tie themselved to eachother in the back of a moving carriage with daggers and stab eachother until one of them died. <br>
       After the carriage had done two laps, the screaming had stopped. The driver left with crippling PTSD and a dead Raoul, <br>
       Barbier won.
