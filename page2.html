        The History of french wars, and why are they known for surrendering?
   </p>


   <h3 class="center2">THE PASTRY WAR</h3>
   <p class="center2">
    Nobody loves their pastry's more than the french. <br>
    1828 a lawless mob destroyed a pasty shop in Mexico, the french chef of said pastry shop, named Remontel was not happy. <br>
    Demanding the Mexican goverment to pay for the damages, he was ignored. He asked the french goverment for help <br> 
    he was ignored again, and it was forgotten (except from the very angry Remontel)<br>
    Ten years later the incident was brought up again to the new King Louis Phillipe <br>
    who was just as mad as Remontel. The King demanded they paid Remontel along with a 90% interest rate <br>
    When the Mexican goverment refused, the french blockaded and took over the city of Veracruz. <br>
    At this point nobody cared about the pastry's it wasn't about that (Exept the very angry Remontel). <br>
    It was about the money. The french stayed until they agreed to pay. This lead to another french invasion. <br>
    But then the french Empire fell, and the war was forgotten by everyone. (Besides a very angry Remontel)

       Basically it's a running Joke the french are easy to beat into sumbission <br>
       why though? In WW2 hitler was able to take over France and beat them into sumbission within weeks <br>
       even visiting the Eifell tower. France had the strongest navy at the time and more men than in WW1 <br>
       This navy fleet could've moved to Ally countries, but it fell into Chaos and the french surrendered.
